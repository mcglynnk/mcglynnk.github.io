I am a biochemist and cancer biologist with a research background in epigenetic mechanisms driving cancer transformation. During my time in the lab, I've enjoyed applying my diverse technical skill set to research problems and tackling projects on a team.  I'm currently putting my skills to use creating two new CRISPR/Cas9 cell lines for ChIP-sequencing experiments! When Iâ€™m not at the bench, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and indoor gardening.
